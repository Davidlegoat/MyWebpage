You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

UI/UX Design Rules (Apple Human Interface Guidelines Inspired)
- Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and consistency in the UI.
- Follow Apple's "content-first" design approach: avoid unnecessary elements.
- Use system fonts for text (e.g., San Francisco); maintain hierarchy with font sizes and weights.
- Ensure components are accessible (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, contrast ratios).
- Design for adaptability: components must work well on various screen sizes and orientations.
- Prefer flat, clean design patterns over skeuomorphic designs.
- Minimize distractions: avoid overusing animations or visual noise.
- Respect system themes (dark/light mode) and user preferences.
- Create intuitive and discoverable navigation using patterns like breadcrumbs or tab bars.

Tailwind + Apple HIG Styling
- Use Tailwind's utility classes to adhere to design principles (e.g., padding, spacing, and alignment).
- Apply consistent margins and spacing based on an 8px grid system.
- Prioritize alignment and symmetry in layouts.
- Use subtle hover and focus states for interactive elements.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Performance Optimization
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Use lazy loading and dynamic imports for non-critical components.
- Minimize 'useEffect' and 'useState' usage; rely on server components where possible.
